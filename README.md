# Openshift PHP Plugin Cartridge
Welcome to the world of [PHP-FPM](http://php.net/manual/en/book.fpm.php) within [openshift](https://www.openshift.com/).

Current this cartridge works well the [boekkooi NGINX cartridge](https://github.com/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-nginx).

You can add this cartridge to your application using:
```BASH
rhc cartridge add -a myapp http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php
```

If you want to install a specific PHP version you can add `--env OPENSHIFT_PHP_VERSION=<version>` to the command.
For example to install PHP 5.5.30 you can use:
```BASH
rhc cartridge add -a myapp --env OPENSHIFT_PHP_VERSION=5.5.30 http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php
```

## Versions
Currently this cartridge has the following versions:
- PHP 5.5.30
- PHP 5.6.16

If you need another version you can compile it yourself and submit a PR to get it integrated.

## Configuration
For the best result with this cartridge you are adviced to create a `.openshift/action_hooks/build` and add the following to it:  
```BASH
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Build PHP extra's
# Update conf/ini filesand install pecl extensions
${OPENSHIFT_PHP_DIR}/bin/control build
```

Now it's time to configure nginx edit your `.openshift/nginx.conf.erb` and add the following within the `server` section:
``` 
# pass the PHP scripts to PHP-FPM
location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass unix:<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_PHP_SOCKET'] %>;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_script_name;
    include <%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_NGINX_DIR'] %>/usr/nginx-<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_NGINX_VERSION'] %>/conf/fastcgi_params;
}
```

### PHP.ini etc. 
If you have created `.openshift/action_hooks/build` you can fully customize the PHP configuration.
In your application create the following directories:
```
.openshift/cli/
.openshift/fpm/
```

In the `cli` directory create the `php.ini.erb` file and copy the content from [`conf/php.ini.erb`](https://github.com/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php/blob/master/conf/php.ini.erb) into it.
Now you can customize the cli php configuration. 

In the `fpm` directory create the `php.ini.erb` file and copy the content from [`conf/php-fpm.ini.erb`](https://github.com/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php/blob/master/conf/php-fpm.ini.erb) into it.
Also create the `php-fpm.conf.erb` file and copy the content from [`conf/php-fpm.ini.erb`](https://github.com/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php/blob/master/conf/php-fpm.conf.erb) into it.
Now you can customize the php-fpm configuration.

## Composer/PEAR
Composer is installed by default and can be used by simply ssh to your application and typing in `composer`. 

So where is PEAR? It's not there! Why? Read [The rise of Composer and the fall of PEAR](http://fabien.potencier.org/article/72/the-rise-of-composer-and-the-fall-of-pear). 
If you really need PEAR then download it your self using [`php go-pear.phar`](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php) and pray it work. *Any PR's related to PEAR or failure to install it will be ignored*

### PECL
If you have created `.openshift/action_hooks/build` you can create the `.openshift/php-pecl.txt` to auto install pecl extensions.
This file must constain have a pecl extension name and version per line for example:
```
apcu 4.0.7
mongo 1.6.5
```

### Phalcon
There is special support for [phalcon](http://phalconphp.com/) you can simply install it by adding the following to your `.openshift/php-pecl.txt` file.
```
phalcon 1.3.4 --enable-phalcon
```
Don't forget to change your `.openshift/nginx.conf.erb` according to the [phalcon nginx installation notes](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/nginx.html).

### Compiling a new version
To compile a new version you will first need a openshift application.
```BASH
rhc create-app nginx http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php
```

Now clone the repository and create a `php` folder. Now copy the `usr/compile` directory from [this](https://github.com/boekkooi/openshift-cartridge-php) repository.
Now set the versions you need to compile in the `php/compile/versions` file. Commit and push the application repository.
  
SSH into your app and go to the compile folder (`cd ${OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR}/php/compile`) and start compiling by running the following commands:
```BASH
./libs
./php
./libs_package
```
Once compiling is done you can download the `php-{version}.tar.gz` from you application. 
Extract the `php-{version}` from the archive and place them into the `openshift-cartridge-php/usr` folder.
Last but not least edit the `openshift-cartridge-php/manifest.yml` and add the versions.

All done just commit and push to your `openshift-cartridge-php` repo and use:
```BASH
rhc cartridge add -a myapp http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/<user>/openshift-cartridge-php
```

## Updates
Updating this catridge is not as easy as I would like because openshift online won't allow updates for downloaded cartridges.
To update the cartridge you can do the following:
```BASH
rhc cartridge remove -a myapp --confirm  php
rhc cartridge add -a myapp http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/<user>/openshift-cartridge-php
```
This will remove the old version and install the latest version.
